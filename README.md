Spree: Content Fragments
========================

Allows adding sections to a product's description page. Sections would perhaps
be one to highlight a feature of a product. They can have CSS and a background
image.

## TODO

See the Issues on the Git repo

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_content_fragments', github: 'WebGents/spree_content_fragments', branch: '3-1-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-1-stable` if you're using Spree `3-1-stable` or any `3.1.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_content_fragments:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_content_fragments/factories'
```
